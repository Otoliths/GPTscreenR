    "Nursing home residents typically have rates of depression, anxiety, and stress (DAS) significantly higher than those of equivalent populations living independently. As well as reducing quality of life and increasing morbidity and mortality, DAS significantly increases the burden on both nursing homes and health systems in caring for the elderly. Recent pilot trials of the use of therapy alpacas have shown promising initial results in reducing DAS among nursing home residents. We conducted a randomised control trial involving 8,124 residents across 17 nursing homes in urban and rural Australia in which residents were randomised to either a weekly 2-hour therapy alpaca visit or equivalent time in a television viewing lounge. Residents receiving the alpaca intervention had significantly (p < 0.01) reduced levels of depression (mean DASS-21 score for depression reduction 8.2 points), anxiety (mean reduction 11 points) and stress (mean reduction 13 points) compared to the control arm. This study represents the first large-scale randomised trial of alpaca therapy for nursing home residents, and provides strong support for its effectiveness in reducing DAS.",
    "Animal-assisted therapy can have positive effects on mental health and well-being in various populations, including the elderly. In this study, we evaluated the impact of therapy alpaca interventions on emotional well-being and social engagement among elderly residents in residential aged care facilities. We conducted a 12-week, longitudinal intervention study with 502 participants from 10 different care facilities. Participants were divided into two groups: an intervention group receiving weekly therapy alpaca visits, and a control group participating in alternative recreational activities. Using a mixed-methods approach, we assessed emotional well-being and social engagement through the Geriatric Depression Scale, the UCLA Loneliness Scale, and qualitative interviews. Our findings indicated that the therapy alpaca group experienced significant improvements in emotional well-being and reduced loneliness compared to the control group (p < 0.05). Residents in the intervention group reported feelings of bonding and joy. This study suggests that therapy alpacas can enhance the mental health and emotional well-being of elderly residents in care facilities.",
    "This comparative study aimed to investigate the effectiveness of therapy ungulate programs versus traditional therapeutic interventions for elderly residents in nursing homes in southern Spain. Outcomes measured included stress reduction, emotional well-being, and overall life satisfaction. Additionally, residents' preferences for therapy animals were assessed. Findings revealed that therapy ungulate programs were comparable to traditional interventions in reducing stress and enhancing emotional well-being, with a subset of participants showing a preference for alpaca-assisted therapy. The study highlights the potential benefits of incorporating therapy alpacas into nursing home programs.", "This longitudinal study aimed to assess the long-term effects of therapy alpaca programs on mental health outcomes and quality of life for elderly residents in residential care facilities. Participants were followed for 18 months, with data collected at baseline, 6 months, 12 months, and 18 months. The results demonstrated sustained improvements in stress reduction, emotional well-being, and overall life satisfaction for participants who engaged in the therapy alpaca program. The study also identified potential physical health benefits, including increased mobility and reduced pain. This study supports the inclusion of therapy alpacas in residential care facilities to promote positive mental health outcomes for elderly residents.", "This systematic review aimed to synthesize the available literature on the effectiveness of therapy alpaca programs for older adults in assisted living facilities. A total of 8 studies were included in the review, with outcomes related to stress reduction, emotional well-being, mental health, and overall life satisfaction assessed. The findings demonstrated consistent positive effects across studies, with therapy alpaca programs leading to significant improvements in emotional well-being and mental health outcomes for older adults. The review also identified gaps in the existing literature, such as the need for more rigorous study designs, larger sample sizes, and more diverse populations. Furthermore, the review highlighted the importance of considering potential barriers to implementing therapy alpaca programs, including staff training and animal welfare concerns. Despite these limitations, the review underscores the potential benefits of therapy alpacas in assisted living facilities and provides recommendations for future research and practice.", "This exploratory study evaluated the feasibility and acceptability of implementing therapy alpaca programs in geriatric care settings, focusing on residents' experiences and staff perspectives. The study utilized a combination of focus groups, interviews, and observation sessions to gather data from facility staff, residents, and family members. Overall, the therapy alpaca program was well-received, with participants reporting improvements in mental health, emotional well-being, and overall life satisfaction. The study also explored potential challenges in implementing such programs, including logistical concerns and animal welfare considerations. The study provides evidence supporting the feasibility and acceptability of therapy alpaca programs in geriatric care settings.",
    "Private Residential Aged Care Facilities (RACFs) in Western countries often struggle to retain residents due to high rates of lifestyle dissatisfaction. This observational study investigated the effect of therapy alpaca programs on resident retention and self-reported quality of life (QOL) in private residential aged care facilities. Data were collected from a sample of elderly residents in two matched facilities in Sydney, Australia, one with an established therapy alpaca program and one without. Resident retention rates were compared over a 12-month period, and self-reported QOL was assessed using a standardized questionnaire. The results indicated that the facility with the therapy alpaca program had significantly higher resident retention rates than the comparison facility. Additionally, residents in the facility with the therapy alpaca program reported higher QOL scores related to emotional well-being and overall life satisfaction. The study suggests that implementing therapy alpaca programs may contribute to improved resident retention and QOL in residential aged care facilities.",
    "Nursing home residents typically have rates of depression, anxiety, and stress (DAS) significantly higher than those of equivalent populations living independently. As well as reducing quality of life and increasing morbidity and mortality, DAS significantly increases the burden on both nursing homes and health systems in caring for the elderly. Recent pilot trials of the use of therapy ungulates including alpacas, llamas, and camels have shown promising initial results in reducing DAS among nursing home residents. We conducted a randomised control trial involving 8,124 residents across 17 nursing homes in urban and rural Australia in which residents were randomised to either a weekly 2-hour therapy ungulate (llama or camel) visit or equivalent time in a television viewing lounge. Residents receiving the ungulate intervention had significantly (p < 0.01) reduced levels of depression (mean DASS-21 score for depression reduction 8.2 points), anxiety (mean reduction 11 points) and stress (mean reduction 13 points) compared to the control arm. This study represents the first large-scale randomised trial of ungulate therapy for nursing home residents, and provides strong support for its effectiveness in reducing DAS.",
    "Japan's aging population poses major social and economic challenges for the country, including a rising burden of mental illness among elderly Japanese living alone. Animal-assisted therapy can have positive effects on mental health and well-being in various populations, including the elderly. In this study, we evaluated the impact of therapy alpaca interventions on emotional well-being and social engagement among elderly people living alone in five Japanese cities and towns. We conducted a 12-week, longitudinal intervention study with 502 participants. Participants were divided into two groups: an intervention group receiving weekly therapy alpaca visits, and a control group participating in alternative recreational activities. Using a mixed-methods approach, we assessed emotional well-being and social engagement through the Geriatric Depression Scale, the UCLA Loneliness Scale, and qualitative interviews. Our findings indicated that the therapy alpaca group experienced significant improvements in emotional well-being and reduced loneliness compared to the control group (p < 0.05). Participants in the intervention group reported feelings of bonding and joy. This study suggests that therapy alpacas can enhance the mental health and emotional well-being of elderly people.", "This comparative study aimed to investigate the effectiveness of therapy ungulate programs versus traditional therapeutic interventions for residents in disability care facilities in South Australia. Five supportive living facilities comprising fifty-nine residents were enrolled in either a commercial therapy ungulate program or a traditional quality of life improvement program. Outcomes measured included stress reduction, emotional well-being, and overall life satisfaction. Additionally, residents' preferences for therapy animals were assessed. Findings revealed that therapy ungulate programs were comparable to traditional interventions in reducing stress and enhancing emotional well-being, with a subset of participants showing a preference for alpaca-assisted therapy. The study highlights the potential benefits of incorporating therapy alpacas into quality of life improvement programs."
