# Overview of data source

The dataset is from the preprint of:

> Ng, J. Y. et al. Complementary, Alternative, and Integrative Medicine-Specific COVID-19 Misinformation on Social Media: A Scoping Review. (2023) doi:10.31219/osf.io/d2mkr.

The file `TITLE ABSTRACT FULL TEXT SCREENING DATA_CAIM COVID-19 SM Misinfo_Mar2223.xlsx` was downloaded on 16 May 2023.

The study aims and inclusion criteria have been drawn from the preprint manuscript.

```{r}
study_description <- str_c(
  sep = "\n",
  "RESEARCH QUESTION: With respect to studies exploring COVID-19 misinformation on social media, how many of them make mention of complementary, alternative, and integrative medicine (CAIM) and what do they report about these therapies?",
  "INCLUSION CRITERIA:",
  str_c(
    sep = "\n",
    "- The study specifically explored COVID-19 misinformation on social media",
    "- In defining social media, we followed a formalized definition to remove ambiguity when determining study eligibility. Obar and Wildman, define social media by the following four characteristics: '1) social media services are (currently) applications that are Web 2.0 Internet-based; 2) the lifeblood of social media is user-generated content; 3) for a site or app designed and maintained by a social media service, individuals and groups create user-specific profiles, and; 4) the development of social networks online by connecting a profile with those of other individuals and/or groups is facilitated by social media services.'",
    "- During title and abstract screening, studies were only selected for inclusion if the information provided in the title or abstract indicated that the study specifically explored COVID-19 misinformation on social media. This meant that a study was considered eligible regardless of whether CAIM was discussed in the articleâ€™s full text. This decision was made to avoid excluding relevant articles that include CAIM discussion in the full text, but not within the title or abstract.",
    "- Only primary research articles are (e.g., cross-sectional studies, descriptive analyses, questionnaire based studies, etc.) were considered and included in this scoping review.",
    "- Review articles were not eligible for inclusion in this review.",
    "- Research protocols, abstracts, editorials, opinion pieces, commentaries, and any non-English texts were not eligible for inclusion in this scoping review."

# Prepare sources list

Load and tidy the sources list.

```{r}
sources <- read_excel("./TITLE ABSTRACT FULL TEXT SCREENING DATA_CAIM COVID-19 SM Misinfo_Mar2223.xlsx", sheet = "Title & Abstract Screening", range = "A2:G673") %>%
  select(title = Title, authors = Authors, DOI, human_recommendation = `Final Decision`)
```

Loaded `r nrow(sources)`.

`r sources %>% filter(human_recommendation == "Maybe") %>% nrow()` sources had 'Maybe' as the human recommendation. These will be removed, as GPTscreenR is designed to provide only a binary include/exclude decision.

```{r}
sources <- sources %>%
  filter(! human_recommendation == "Maybe")
```

`r sources %>% filter(DOI == "No DOI") %>% nrow()` sources had 'No DOI', these will be removed.

```{r}
sources <- sources %>%
  filter(! DOI == "No DOI")
```

The remaining DOIs will be cleaned.

```{r}
sources <- sources %>%
  mutate(DOI = map_chr(DOI, ~ str_match(.x, "https?://(dx\\.)?doi\\.org/(?<doi>.+)")[1,"doi"]))
```

# Screen titles and abstracts

Only sources with an available abstract (`r sources %>% filter(! is.na(abstract)) %>% nrow()`) will be screened.

```{r}
sources <- sources %>% filter(! is.na(abstract))
sources <- screen_sources(sources, study_description, n = 50,
                          cache_file = fs::path("./COVID_sources.rds"))
```
