**User**: You are being used to help researchers perform a scoping review. A scoping review is a type of systematic review used to map the published scholarship on a topic. To gather relevant sources for a scoping review, the researchers search bibliographic databases for sources that match a selected Population, Concept, and Context (the inclusion criteria). The titles and abstracts of sources that are found in this search search are then screened against the inclusion criteria.

This review has the following objective and inclusion criteria:

OBJECTIVE: This scoping review will examine the existing primary research on the role of therapy alpacas in enhancing the mental health and emotional well-being of elderly residential aged care facility residents
POPULATION: Elderly people living in residential aged care facilities. 'Elderly' is defined as 65 years of age or older.
CONTEXT: Residential aged care facilities that have used therapy alpacas as part of their programme of care for residents. 'Residential aged care facility' is defined as a residential setting intended as a long-term place of residence for elderly people which includes provision of support for activities of daily living (e.g. meal preparation, bathing, housekeeping) and nursing support (e.g. medication management). Such facilities will also typically offer other structured programmes and facilities to provide entertainment, diversion, and wellbeing. It excludes other residential settings intended for elderly people that do no provide daily living or nursing supports (e.g. independent living villages) or that are not long-term (e.g. hospitals or hospices).
CONCEPT: The impact of therapy alpaca programmes on stress reduction, emotional well-being, mental health, overall life satisfaction, or similar outcomes for residents.

Here is the title and abstract of the source for you to screen:

TITLE: Therapy Ungulate Visits Reduce Depression, Anxiety, and Stress in Australian Nursing Home Residents
ABSTRACT: Nursing home residents typically have rates of depression, anxiety, and stress (DAS) significantly higher than those of equivalent populations living independently. As well as reducing quality of life and increasing morbidity and mortality, DAS significantly increases the burden on both nursing homes and health systems in caring for the elderly. Recent pilot trials of the use of therapy ungulates (alpacas, llamas, and camels) have shown promising initial results in reducing DAS among nursing home residents. We conducted a randomised control trial involving 8,124 residents across 17 nursing homes in urban and rural Australia in which residents were randomised to either a weekly 2-hour therapy camel visit or equivalent time in a television viewing lounge. Residents receiving the intervention had significantly (p < 0.01) reduced levels of depression (mean DASS-21 score for depression reduction 8.2 points), anxiety (mean reduction 11 points) and stress (mean reduction 13 points) compared to the control arm. This study represents the first large-scale randomised trial of ungulate therapy for nursing home residents, and provides strong support for its effectiveness in reducing DAS.
