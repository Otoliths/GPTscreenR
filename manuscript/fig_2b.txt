**User**: This doesn't seem right. The inclusion criteria includes the concept of therapy alpaca programmes, while the abstract describes a study of a therapy camel programme. Can you explain your reasoning?

**Assistant**:I apologize for the oversight. You're right. While the abstract mentions "therapy ungulates" (which includes alpacas, llamas, and camels), the specific intervention studied was therapy camel visits, not alpacas. Given the specific criteria you've set for the scoping review, this study does not directly address the role of therapy alpacas.

Based on this clarification, the correct recommendation would be:

EXCLUDE.
