  \User This doesn't seem right. The inclusion criteria includes the concept of
  therapy alpaca programmes, while the abstract describes a study of a therapy
  camel programme. Can you explain your reasoning?

  \GPT I apologize for the oversight. You're right. While the abstract mentions
  "therapy ungulates" (which includes alpacas, llamas, and camels), the
  specific intervention studied was therapy camel visits, not alpacas. Given
  the specific criteria you've set for the scoping review, this study does not
  directly address the role of therapy alpacas.

  Based on this clarification, the correct recommendation would be:

  EXCLUDE.
